        <p>This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for supersimpletutorials.com. This site is owned and operated by <a href="https://rightclickdesign.co" target="_blank">Right Click Design, LLC</a> ("RCD"). We care about your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating this web site. Please note: this privacy policy is available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, originally created by the classy people at Automattic.</p>

        <h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>

        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hi@supersimpletutorials.com" target="_blank">hi@supersimpletutorials.com</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="visitors">Visitors</h3>
        <p>Like most website operators, RCD collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. RCD's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how RCD’s visitors use its website. From time to time, RCD may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

        <p>RCD also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. RCD does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violate our Terms of Service.</p>

        <h3 id="gathering-of-personally-identifying-information">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>Certain visitors to supersimpletutorials.com choose to interact with RCD in ways that require RCD to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that RCD gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a account at supersimpletutorials.com to provide a name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with RCD - by purchasing access to a paid service, for example - are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, RCD collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with RCD. RCD does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

        <h3 id="aggregated-statistics">Aggregated Statistics</h3>
        <p>RCD may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. RCD may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, RCD does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

        <h3 id="protection-of-certain-personally-identifying-information">Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>RCD discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on RCD's behalf or to provide services available at supersimpletutorials.com, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using supersimpletutorials.com, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. RCD will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, RCD discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when RCD believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of RCD, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of supersimpletutorials.com and have supplied your email address, RCD may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with RCD and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. RCD takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

        <h3 id="cookies">Cookies</h3>
        <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. RCD uses cookies to help RCD identify and track visitors, their usage of develohero.com and their website access preferences. RCD visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using supersimpletutorials.com with the drawback that certain features of supersimpletutorials.com may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

        <h3 id="business-transfers">Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>If RCD, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that RCD goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of RCD may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

        <h3 id="third-party-content">Third-party Content</h3>
        <p>Third-party content appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the partner to recognize your computer each time you interact with the content to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by RCD and does not cover the use of cookies by any partners.</p>

        <h3 id="privacy-policy-changes">Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
        <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, RCD may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in RCD’s sole discretion. RCD encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
