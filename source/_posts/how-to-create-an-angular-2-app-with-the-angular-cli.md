## How to create an Angular 2 app with the [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/)

### Run these commands

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app
```

### Run server

```bash
ng serve
```

The `ng serve` command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.

Open a browser on `http://localhost:4200/` to see your work.

### Build for production

```bash
ng build --prod
```
